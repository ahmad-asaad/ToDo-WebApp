# To-Do Web App

A To-Do Web App made using Node.js
and MongoDB to store the ToDo list items online.

I used the Express module to handle the requests/responses,
and the MVC approach to organize my code.

You can find the instructions below.


*For the JavaScript/HTML only version, check the `master-old` branch:* https://github.com/ahmad-asaad/ToDo-WebApp/tree/master-old


Note : I did not make the HTML and CSS used in this project.

## How To Use :

**PS: The website uses a hosted MongoDB to store the ToDo list. Therefore, please don't add too many things, so other people can try it out.**

1. Download the files in this repository
2. Open it in Visual Code Studio **(Make sure you have "Node" installed on your computer)**
3. Open a new terminal, and type the command `npm install`
4. After the download/installation finishes, type the command `nodemon start`
5. Wait for the terminal to show you "Connected to MongoDB" as the following:
```console
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node start server.js`
Connected to MongoDB
`````
6. The website should be up and running in http://localhost:3000/
7. Done !
